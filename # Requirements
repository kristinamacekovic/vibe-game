# Requirements
Let's create a fun, chill game that follows these requirements:

- game has to be accessible on web without any login or signup and free-to-play (preferrably its own domain or subdomain)
- game has to be multiplayer by default
- can use any engine but usually ThreeJS is recommended
- NO loading screens and heavy downloads (!!!) has to be almost instantly in the game (except maybe ask username if you want)

I prefer a chill multiplayer vibe but we can brainstorm ideas!
